# rash-model-to-analyse-cricket-data

## Abstract
 In this project, we use Cricket Test match data from cricsheet to evaluate the performance of
 national cricket teams. We use multiple approaches to assess a team’s performance and state each
 approach’s merits and demerits. We start with a frequentist approach followed by a 1-parameter
 logistic (1pl) Rasch model followed by a 2-parametric logistic (2pl) Rasch model. In each section, we
 will evaluate the results of the models and discuss them. In the last section, we will compare results
 between different models. The code is provided at the end so that the results can be recreated.

The repository consists of 3 main files.
* Rash_model_on_cricket_data.pdf: contains the writeup in pdf format
* Rash_model_on_cricket_data.html: contains the report in HTML format
* rash_model_notebook.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing code
